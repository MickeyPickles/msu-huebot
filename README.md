# msu-huebot
code for the chatbot workshop


YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE BRIDGEID AND TOKEN IN THE hue.js file for the light to actually work.  

This is a node.js app meant to work with api.ai and a Philips Hue light. You can import the file called HueTestBot.zip into api.ai directly.  I deployed my app on Heroku but you can deploy it wherever you want.
